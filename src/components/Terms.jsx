              files, an audio file, a video file or computer software. By making

            </p>

            <p>
              The downloading, copying and use of the Content will not infringe
              the proprietary rights, including but not limited to the
              copyright, patent, trademark or trade secret rights, of any third
              party;

              and does not contain unethical or unwanted commercial content

              contain threats or incite violence towards individuals or
              entities, and does not violate the privacy or publicity rights of
              any third party; your account is not getting advertised via
              unwanted electronic messages such as spam links on newsgroups,
              email lists, other blogs and web sites, and similar unsolicited
              promotional methods;
